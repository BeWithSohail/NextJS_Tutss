## Automatic Installation

We recommend starting a new Next.js app using create-next-app, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

Terminal

npx create-next-app@latest
On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

Terminal

What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
After the prompts, create-next-app will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

If you're new to Next.js, see the project structure docs for an overview of all the possible files and folders in your application.
